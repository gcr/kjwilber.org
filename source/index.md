# Replit Eleventy
This is a template to easily create a multipage website with <a href="https://11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>!   
Or, as commonly used, a blog.

# What's <a href="https://11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>?
Eleventy is a static site generator, and it creates websites 
from Markdown files and other files if configured to do so.  

But enough about Eleventy at it's core, you can read about it on <a href="https://11ty.dev/">the website</a>. (I've linked it enough already.)

# How do I use this template?
It's simple! All the files needed are in the `/source` and `/static` folders.

## The `/source` folder
The `/source` folder keeps the layouts and the pages.
For example, `index.md` is this page! <!-- Hello viewer! This is correct! -->

### What's `/source/layouts`?
Easy to say, it's just the layouts for the pages. All the pages on this demo use `main.njk` as the layout.

## The `/static` folder
The `/static` folder houses the static, non-modified files.  
Example: The `style.css` file, which makes this page look <span class="pretty">pretty</span>.  

You might also be wondering what the `/_site` folder is, too.

## The `/_site` folder
Simply put: <span style="color: red;">DO NOT EDIT</span>!  
This folder is an auto-generated folder,
and it just houses the generated website content.

## *eyes `.eleventy.js`*
Oh, that `.eleventy.js` is the config file for eleventy, 
and you can edit it all you want
as long as you know what you're doing.  

# This is YOUR page
This template is your oyster!

You can change the layout of all the files as long as you know what you're doing!

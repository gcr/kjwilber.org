        Our team built a system to help scientists track the population of endangered ground squirrels and desert tortoises living near the Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert. This is a challenging detection and recognition task - the animals of interest are only a few pixels tall and are easily confused with non-endangered species.

        Most biometrics systems compromise users' privacy by storing their data in large biometrics databases that can be searched by law enforcement and rogue actors. Our Vaulted Verification work allows users to authenticate their accounts, but requires their cooperation to verify their identity, so it cannot be used in large-scale search databases.

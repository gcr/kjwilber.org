        What's the difference between depth estimation, semantic segmentation, and surface normal prediction? Less than you might think. Previous work converged on similar approaches for each, so we decided to unify them in one simple transformer-based architecture.

        We created a dataset that stretches the limits of state-of-the-art obstacle detection and scene understanding systems. Our dataset, SANPO, includes 112,000 frames of egocentric video from a runner's perspective, annotated with panoptic segmentations and depth maps. We also include 113,000 synthetic frames from virtual environments. This was a collaboration between Google, Project Guideline, and Parallel Domain.

This is a challenging detection and recognition task - the animals of interest are only a few pixels tall and are easily confused with non-endangered species.

Our Vaulted Verification work allows users to authenticate their accounts, but requires their cooperation to verify their identity, so it cannot be used in large-scale search databases.

Hello! I'm a machine learning researcher in NYC currently working as a software engineer at Google AI. Before graduating in 2018, I was a Ph.D. student at the [Cornell Tech SE(3) Vision Group](http://vision.cornell.edu/se3/) under [Dr. Serge Belongie](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~sjb/). I previously worked as a research assistant in the [Vision and Security Technology lab](http://vast.uccs.edu/) and as a software engineer at [Securics, Inc.](http://securics.com/), both under [Terrance E. Boult](http://vast.uccs.edu/~tboult).

My hobbies include peer counseling, bouldering (still a beginner, VB-V1), lifting (beginner), hiking, and finding delicious quiet places in the city to drink tea and read books.

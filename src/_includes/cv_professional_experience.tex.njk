  2013--Present&\textbf{Volunteer publication assistant, Computer Vision Foundation}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item I help the CV Foundation process papers for the \href{https://openaccess.thecvf.com/menu}{CVF Open Access Archive}, a complete repository of CVPR, ICCV, and WACV papers.
  \item To help prepare conference proceedings, I built a pipeline that processes over 2,700 camera-ready papers provided by authors for each conference.
  \item Every machine learning researcher who reads open-access CVPR papers in the last 11 years has touched PDF files generated by the infrastructure I maintain.
  \item My pipeline adds page numbers, an attribution banner, and proper PDF metadata, with automatic checks for common quality problems (figures overlapping margins, etc).

  2018--2024&\textbf{Software Engineer, Google AI, New York, NY}
\begin{itemize}
\item Implemented real-time, on-device monocular depth estimation models for \href{https://research.google/blog/open-sourcing-project-guideline-a-platform-for-computer-vision-accessibility-technology/}{Project Guideline}, a tool that helps visually impaired runners exercise independently. My models improved Google's outdoor depth estimation capabilities.
\item Helped create \href{https://research.google/blog/sanpo-a-scene-understanding-accessibility-navigation-pathfinding-obstacle-avoidance-dataset/}{SANPO}, a 3D panoptic video dataset for the computer vision community. My role was to create large-scale data processing infrastructure and to shepherd the collection of 3D depth data.
\item Created and refactored internal debug tools for \textit{RankEmbed}, one of Google Web Search's first forays into NLP embeddings for web search. My tools helped engineers demo the fledgling product to executives to build support.
\item Built a reputation as a strong visual communicator -- others relied on me to produce publication-ready figures and graphics for papers and presentations authored during my tenure.

\\
  2014--2018&\textbf{Research Assistant, Cornell University, Cornell Tech NYC}
\begin{itemize}
\item Conducted computer vision research on %on many areas of computer vision including
 perceptual similarity, %large-scale
 crowdsourcing, and object recognition.
\item Helped establish and maintain the new vision group's presence at Cornell.
\item Served as TA for classes including four semesters of ``CS5785
  Modern Analytics.''

\end{itemize}
\\
  2017&\textbf{Summer Intern, Google Photos Team, Mountain View, CA}
\begin{itemize}
\item Implemented and tested tools to make it easier for ML engineers to prototype UI interactions.
\item These tools helped other engineers decide what features to include in \href{https://support.google.com/photos/answer/7378859?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop}{Google Photos Sharing Suggestions}.
\vspace{5pt}
\end{itemize}
\\
  2016&\textbf{Summer Intern, Adobe Research, San Jose, CA}
\begin{itemize}
\item Curated \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08614}{BAM}, one of the first large-scale collections of professional commercial artwork, intended for ML object classification and emotion understanding.
\item Built a data loader system in Python and Redis to quickly analyze millions of images for ML training and inference workloads, speeding up training by 5$\times$.

\end{itemize}
\\
  2014&\textbf{Summer Intern, Dropbox Photos Team, San Francisco, CA}
\begin{itemize}
\item Conducted product-focused computer vision research.
\item Introduced our team to more efficient tools and technologies.
\item Maintained a computer vision evaluation and experimentation pipeline.

%\end{itemize}
\\
2011&{\bf Summer Researcher, NSF REU Program, University of Colorado
  Colorado Springs, CO}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Designed and implemented a privacy-enhanced biometric
%  authentication protocol, ``Vaulted Verification.'' This work
%  resulted in a provisional patent application, two first-author
%  conference papers, and scored fourth place in the \emph{2012 National
%    Security Innovation Competition} sponsored by the National
%  Homeland Defense Foundation.
%% \item Involved researching privacy-protected biometrics, security
%%   issues in networks and computer vision, and developing a framework
%%   for massively parallel distributed computing to complete experiments
